# CarromSimulate
A simple physics solver for a carrom simulation.

To play around:

1) Right click to add disks

2) Put CAPS on and left drag with mouse to drag the disks around

3) To strike with a disk put CAPS off and left drag with mouse, the rubber line length determines the speed to shoot the disk with
